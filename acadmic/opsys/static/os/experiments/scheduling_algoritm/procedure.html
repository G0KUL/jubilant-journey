<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>
	This simulation covers different scheduling algorithms like First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First, Shortest Remaining Time First, Round Robin and Priority scheduling.
	Student can solve one scheduling example using different scheduling algorithms and can find out the difference in the performance.
</p>
<p>
	In order to run this simulation, student has to select the desired algorithm first and give necessary input values. Following is the detailed procedure to perform the experiments:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open Simulation page</li>
	<li>Choose the scheduling algorithm of your interest.</li>
	<li>Enter the count of participating processes.</li>
	<li>Enter the input values:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>
				If the algorithm selected is FCFS or SJF or SRTF then 
				<ul>
					<li>Enter the Arrival Time and Burst Time for each process</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				If the algorithm selected is Round Robin then
				<ul>
					<li>Enter the Burst time of each process</li>
					<li>Enter the Quantum time </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				If the algorithm selected is Priority Based scheduling which is non-preemptive version:
				<ul>
					<li>Enter the Priority, Arrival Time and Burst time for every process</li>
					<li>Bigger number is higher priority</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Click on Simulate button</li>
	<li>Simulation begins, the table below 'Next' button will show the order in which processes are executed and in main table student can see the Finish time, Turn Around Time and Waiting Time calculated for each process whose execution is completed.</li>
	<li>Keep clicking next button till all the processes are not executed.</li>
	<li>Simulation ends once execution of all processes is over.</li>
</ol>
