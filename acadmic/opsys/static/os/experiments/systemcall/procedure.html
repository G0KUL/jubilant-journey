<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>
	System calls are executed in privileged/kernel mode. User programs are executed in user mode. User programs may need operating system service so they can invoke the system call to get the operating system service. When system call is invoked, operating system needs to change the execution mode from user mode to kernel mode in order to execute the system call. This simulation will demonstrate how this happens.

<ol>
	<li>Open the simulation page</li>
	<li>There is only one button on simulation page named 'Next'.</li>
	<li>Simulation will show step by step procedure of how operating system changes its execution mode from user mode to kernel mode to execute system call and again switches back to user mode to continue execution of user program.</li>
	<li>Click Next button to see the next step of demonstration.</li>
	<li>Keep clicking the Next button to see the next steps until simulation is over.</li>
