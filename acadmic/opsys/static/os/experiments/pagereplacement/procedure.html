<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>
	Simulation covers the common page replacement algorithms like Optimal Page Replacement, Least Recently Used and First In First Out.
</p>
Procedure is as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Open the Simulation page</li>
	<li>Student has to provide 3 inputs values</li>
	<li>Enter the reference string. Reference string is the sequence of pages requested from the secondary memory. 
		<ul>
			<li>Page number must be single character.</li>
			<li>You can use the characters [a-z, A-Z, 0-9] to represent a page number.</li>
			<li>Don't use any separator between page number.</li>
			<li>ex. if reference string is [1,2,3,4,0,a,b,C] then you should provide input as: "12340abC" without double quotes.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Enter the number of frames available in main memory.</li>
	<li>Choose appropriate algorithm for the simulation.</li>
	<li>Click Simulate Button to see the Visual Simulation of Page Replacement step by step</li>
	<li>Click next button to see the next step and observe the changes</li>
	<li>Click Next button every time to perform next step</li>
</ol>
