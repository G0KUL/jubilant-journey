<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Simulation is to show the execution flow of fork system call.</li>
	<li>when fork system call is executed, it creates new process and fork returns pid of child process to parent and returns 0 to child process.</li>
	<li>Simulation is a demonstration of what happens if "Child completes execution before parent" and "Parent completes execution before child". </li>
	<li>Click on one of two radio buttons of above two options and click Simulate button</li>
	<li>Observe the flow of execution and wait for simulation to complete</li>
	<li>Simulate button will get disabled once simulation starts and will be enabled back once the simulation ends</li>
	<li>Once simulation ends you can start another simulation.</li>
	
</ul>
